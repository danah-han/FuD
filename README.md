# FuD
füD is an iOS app. With füD, restaurants can post deals for their leftover food (i.e. 50% off all pizzas till closing time), and 
in turn, receive exposure and increased revenue from our database of users browsing the app for late night eats.

Explain:
-ParseUI/Xcode workspace vs. Xcode project
-TestCell; TestFeed
*may need to change outlets and classes referenced for it to work in simulator
