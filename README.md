# FuD
füD is an iOS app that helps restaurants sell food destined for the garbage can. It connects younger people looking for cheaper late night meals with the local businesses who have excess food. Using füD, restaurants can post deals for their leftover food (i.e. 50% off all pizzas till closing time), and in turn, receive exposure and increased revenue from our database of users browsing the app for late night eats.
