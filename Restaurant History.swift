//Swift file for the Restaurant History view controller. The set-up of Restaurant History is very similar to the Restaurant Feed view controller except Restaurant History will only have the previous posts of the specific restaurant currently logged in to the app. Only this specific restaurant user will be able to view his or her previous posts. He or she will also have the ability to use a previous post again as a new deal post.
//Code for this file has not yet been written.
class Restaurant_History: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet var HistoryTable: UITableView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Section to do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Section to dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }
